**"Dream big. Set goals. Take action."**
 
These are some of the principles I believe in and by which I am guided. 
I am currently a nurse, but I aspire to a successful career in IT. 
I am not afraid of new beginnings and I seek to be better in order to bring value to those around me and to fulfil my dreams. 
I am a serious person but with a sense of humour, meticulous and attentive to details, but taking care not to lose sight of the big picture. 
I like challenges, I like to create, learn, evolve, to leave my comfort zone. 
I am results-oriented, with an analytical, flexible, organized and orderly mind and I'm a very persevering person. 
All together with a positive attitude and smiles.
