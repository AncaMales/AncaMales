**"Dream big. Set goals. Take action."**
 
These are some of the principles that guide me. I am a nurse currently, but I aspire to have a successful career in IT. I am not afraid of new beginnings and I strive to improve myself to bring value to those around me and to achieve my dreams. I am a serious person but with a good sense of humor, meticulous and detail-oriented, yet I do not lose sight of the bigger picture. I welcome challenges, enjoy creating, learning, evolving, and stepping out of my comfort zone. I am results-oriented, with an analytical, flexible, organized, and persistent mindset, and I always have a positive attitude and smiles.
